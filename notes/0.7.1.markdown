Biggest change: upgraded from CodeMirror to ACE (former Bespin) as editor... on browsers other than MSIE... need to work on that

fixed options issue where interpreter screws up for strings indented with spaces

fixed options not showing up due to un-escaped \\

still use CodeMirror on IE and embedded

added titles for the main pages and cleaned up some code

fixed code assisst in the middle of a string

started to revive the embedding option - needs a bit of work
