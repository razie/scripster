<h1>When would you use CodeWitter</h1>

<p>Well, to tweet your witty code to the world, baby! Nah, really! ...but also, 


<h2>Eureka #1</h2>

<p>You're the average Joe and you just had this decade's "Eureka" moment. Surely you'll tweet it to
the world, to get the obvious reply "ain't working, dude, try this way!".


<h2>You're me</h2>

You just solved something interesting, which happens quite often. It was something really hard to solve. 
Obviously the best minds couldn't. You would blog it... but, you solve soo many of these things, 
you don't have the time to come up with a worldly (or wordy) wrapper for your witty code. So you 
just tweet it!


<h2>Eureka #2</h2>

<p>You're a closet show-off... this is your one chance to come out and shine...

<p>...I was about to delete this one, but it actually applies to me as well, so it maybe applies to 
you too...think about it!


<h2>Chimp #4324324132987</h2>

<p>You're the lucky chimp who typed all the letters of this web address in the right sequence. 
You deserve a banana. Now type that!


<h2>Eureka #3</h2>

<p>Yeah...I know, dude...that was hard. What?? You don't want to tweet it? You gotta be kidding me!
