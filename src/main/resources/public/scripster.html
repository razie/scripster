<p>Try and share scala code, using the Scripster, by <a href="http://www.razie.com">Razvan Cojocaru</a>. 
See the <a href="http://wiki.homecloud.ca/scripster">guide</a>, 
<a href="http://razie-scripster.962791.n3.nabble.com/">forum</a> or brush up on your 
<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/1305">scala</a>.
<p>The current version is built on scala 2.9.1 and includes 
<a href="https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz">scalaz 6.0.1</a>, a 
<a href="http://github.com/razie/gremlins">scala workflow DSL</a> and the 
<a href="http://github.com/razie/snakked">snakking framework</a>. 
If you'd like to see more libraries included, please post on the forum.
<ul>
<li>refresh page to get a new "session"
<li>F9 - runs current line
<li>CTRL+F9 runs the current selection
<li>CTRL+SPACE for content assist
</ul>

<p>Please note that this is a server that runs somewhere, i.e. <code>println ("Hello")</code> will print in the server log files. If you want to see <code>3</code> just type <code>1+2</code>... not <code>println(1+2)</code>

<p>Known issues:
<ul>
<li>due to some Javascript/DOM incompatibilities that I don't understand, content assist doesn't work in I.E.
<li>if you encounter any issues, please refresh the browser (F5) - that will create a new session. You will loose the contents of the pad, so it would be a good idea to copy them beforehand.
<li>sessions expire in about 2-3 minutes and there's max 10...memory ain't cheap
<li>there should be no interaction between sessions...but, this is not fully tested yet.

<p>Some of the 3<superscript>rd</superscript> party libraries used:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://codemirror.net">CodeMirror</a> - an editable iframe-based code editor in JavaScript
<li>the scala parser
<li><a href="http://jline.sourceforge.net/">JLine</a> - a Java library for handling console input, we're using the one bundled with scala
</ul>
